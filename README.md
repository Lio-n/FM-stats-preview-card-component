## My process

### What I learned

In the first instance I mostly used the pixel unit,
but this didn't get the result I wanted.

So for this challenge I learned to use 'Rem' units,
and to make it more flexible.

I think that's all for now. :D

### Continued development

I need to get better at using relative units, naming classes,
reusing classes and using pseudo-classes/pseudo-elements.

And something else.

### Useful resources

Use this website to improve with 'Em' and 'Rem' units.
